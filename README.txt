ResearcherBuddy

ResearcherBuddy is a simple web application that helps students, professionals, and researchers explore and understand academic content more easily. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process questions, research papers, and websites, and then provides clear answers, summaries, and research gap detection.

This project is developed under the DexterityCoder brand.
